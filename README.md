# Bloc state management

Repo for my Bloc state management course (https://youtu.be/Mn254cnduOY)

## Getting Started

Each step of the course is in its own tag and commit so either check the various commits out or go to various tags.

I have deleted the Firebase project backing this app for security reasons so before you get started, set up your firebase backend as shown in the course (https://youtu.be/Mn254cnduOY)
